Hi, I'm Kathrine Esten. Currently, I am a graduate student in the Master's of Public Policy program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. A New England native, I have always valued the rich heritage of our communities. With extensive experience in museums and similar institutions, I hope to apply my knowledge of public history practices and policy analysis to the preservation of historical and cultural resources.

During my time at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I obtained Bachelors degrees in Political Science and History. During my time at UMass, I was the Assistant News Editor and Copy Editor of the [Massachusetts Daily Collegian](https://dailycollegian.com/), the campus newspaper.
